# Data Mining: a  LEANER approach

<img align=right width=300 src="wiki/leanRoboToolboxSmall.jpg">
LEANER is a data mining toolbox. It is the _least_  Python I can write to 
_most_ illustrate  data mining. Turns out,
data mining is easy if
you follow three simple rules:

1. Find some crap;
2. Cut the crap;
3. Go to step 1.

## Installation

LEANER uses a standard UNIX environment (with git,
make, python 2.7+, bash, awk, etc).
