# This is LEANER

LEANER is the least Python I can write to illustrate
the most about data mining. Turns out,
data mining is easy if
you follow three simple rules:

1. Find some crap;
2. Cut the crap;
3. Go to step 1.

LEANER needs a standard UNIX environment (with git,
make, python 2.7+, bash, awk, etc).  To install and test, use
the following.


```
git clone https://github.com/ai-se/leaner.git
make test 
```
