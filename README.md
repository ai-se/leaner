# This is LEANER

"I would not give a fig for the simplicity this side
of complexity, but I would give my life for the
simplicity on the other side of complexity."  
-- _Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr._

LEANER is the least Python I can write to illustrate
the most about data mining. Turns out, after decades
of writing data miners, the great secret can now be
revealed. Data mining is easy, if you follow three
simple rules:

1. Find some crap;
2. Cut the crap;
3. Go to step 1.

LEANER needs a standard UNIX environment (with git, make, python 2.7+, etc).
To install and test it, use the following:


```
git clone https://github.com/ai-se/leaner.git
make test
```
