# This is LEANER

"I would not give a fig for the simplicity this side
of complexity, but I would give my life for the
simplicity on the other side of complexity."  
-- _Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr._

LEANER is the least Python I can write to illustrate
the most about data mining. After decades
of data mining research, the great secrets can now be
revealed. Data miners are software and good data
miners need to be written and maintained by good
software engineers.  Also, data mining is easy if
you follow three simple rules:

1. Find some crap;
2. Cut the crap;
3. Go to step 1.

LEANER needs a standard UNIX environment (with git,
make, python 2.7+, etc).  To install and test, use
the following.


```
git clone https://github.com/ai-se/leaner.git
make test 
```
